# Gesture-Recognition

MPU6050 and ESP8266 based gesture recognition program

Technical Aspects:

    Board used: Adafruit Feather M0 ESP8266 Huzzah
    Accelerometer: MPU6050
    IDE: Arduino IDE
    Coding Language: C
    Processor: ARM

Objectives:

    Use the data collected from a single accelerometer and/or magnetometer to record a hand movement sequence as a means to generally “unlock” a resource.
    Recorded sequence must be saved on the microcontroller, using a “Record Key” feature. (I am using a serial monitor input for this. NOTE: The LED is continuously     glowing when its recording)
    User then must replicate the key sequence within sufficient tolerances to unlock the resource. (User must press detect pattern in the serial monitor)
    A successful unlock must be indicated by a visual indication, such as an LED or similar indicator. (NOTE: The LED glows when it successfully detects the correct     gesture and unlocks.)

Logic Used:

    Using the MPU, I collected RAW data of the acceleration. (Ignored Gyroscope)
    Each movement will have 3 coordinates (i.e. aX, aY, aZ)
    I am recording 10 gesture movements for better accuracy.
    Then normalizing the data based on linear algebra.
    And using this normalized data to make decision whether the entered gesture matches the saved gesture and how close the match is.
    Three commands: Record, Detect and Delete are available
